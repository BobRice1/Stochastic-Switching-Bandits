# Bandit Behaviour Modelling Project

This project reproduces and extends the behavioural models from
Beron et al. (2022), using the authors’ public code.

## Structure
- `reproduction/` — unmodified original code and reproduced figures
- `extensions/` — all new models and analyses developed by our group
- `scripts/` — helper scripts (data download, setup)
- `report/` — writing and notes
